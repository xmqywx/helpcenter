Withdrawing New Zealand dollars from CoinByte to your bank account is a simple process.

If this is your first withdrawal, you will need to:

<TickList>
  <li><strong><a href="/helpcenter/docs/deposits-withdrawals/bank-account/link-a-bank-account">link a bank account</a></strong> to your CoinByte account before withdrawing funds.</li>
  <li><strong>For personal accounts:</strong> Withdrawals must be made to your personal bank account.</li>
  <li><strong>For corporate accounts:</strong> Withdrawals must be made to the bank account linked to that company.</li>
</TickList>

<WarningBox>
💡 <strong>Please note:</strong><br/>
If this is your first withdrawal on CoinByte and you haven’t made any deposits before, you’ll need to complete a deposit of at least 10 NZD first to verify the authenticity of your withdrawal account. You can refer to <strong><a href="/helpcenter/docs/deposits-withdrawals/deposit-fiat-asset/deposit-new-zealand-dollars">Deposit New Zealand dollars</a></strong> to learn how to deposit NZD.
