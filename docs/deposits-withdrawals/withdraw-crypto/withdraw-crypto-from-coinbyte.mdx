## Memo codes or Destination Tags

Transactions on some networks, such as Stellar (XLM), Cosmos (ATOM), and Ripple (XRP), will require additional information in the “Memo” field.  

In a similar way to when you pay your rent or send funds to a bank account, the receiver requires a “reference code” to identify who the transaction is from. A message like the one shown will indicate if it’s needed for your transaction.

Always ensure you include this information to avoid permanent loss of funds.

## How long does crypto withdrawal take?

## Limits

<InfoBox>
💡<strong>Limits include both cash and crypto transactions.</strong>
</InfoBox>

- Minimum withdrawal amounts differ depending on the asset and the chosen network. You can see minimum withdrawal amounts in each asset's withdrawal page .
- <strong>Daily maximum withdrawal:</strong> $50,000 AUD equivalent.
