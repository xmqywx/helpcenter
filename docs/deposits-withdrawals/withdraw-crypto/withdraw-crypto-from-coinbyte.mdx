## Memo codes or Destination Tags

Transactions on some networks, such as Stellar (XLM), Cosmos (ATOM), and Ripple (XRP), will require additional information in the ‚ÄúMemo‚Ä?field.  

In a similar way to when you pay your rent or send funds to a bank account, the receiver requires a ‚Äúreference code‚Ä?to identify who the transaction is from. A message like the one shown will indicate if it‚Äôs needed for your transaction.

Always ensure you include this information to avoid permanent loss of funds.
