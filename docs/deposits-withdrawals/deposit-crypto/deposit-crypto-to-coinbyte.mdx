# Deposit Crypto to CoinByte

Depositing crypto to CoinByte is a simple and fast process, but it's essential to carefully verify the deposit address and choose the correct network before initiating the transfer.

<WarningBox>
⚠️<strong>Important notice:</strong> If you send crypto using incorrect details, we may not be able to recover the funds. If recovery is possible, it may incur significant fees. <strong>Always double-check addresses before sending crypto.</strong>
</WarningBox>

Before sending or receiving crypto, it's important to understand <strong>how to select the appropriate network</strong>. Choosing the wrong network can result in your funds not reaching the intended address and the funds will be lost. Also, each asset on CoinByte has a unique deposit address, so you'll need to find the specific address for the asset you want to deposit.

<InfoBox>
<strong>💡Supported network notice:</strong>
<TickList>
<li>Currently we only support deposits and withdrawals via a crypto's <strong>main network</strong>.</li>
<li>Please do not deposit from or withdraw to other networks, as your funds may be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> For BTC, only deposits on the <strong>Bitcoin network</strong> are supported. BTC sent via BEP-20 or ERC-20 will not be credited and cannot be recovered.</li>
</TickList>
</InfoBox>

We suggest reading our FAQ article, which explains how networks work and how to select the right one:

## Memo codes or Destination Tags

Transactions on some networks, such as Stellar (XLM), Cosmos (ATOM), and Ripple (XRP), will require additional information in the “Memo” field.  
In a similar way to when you pay rent or transfer via bank, the receiver requires a “reference code” to identify who the transaction is from.

Always ensure to check whether a memo/destination tag is required for the asset you're depositing. If you fail to include it when required, you will lose your funds.

## How long do crypto deposits take?

Crypto deposits may take up to 1 hour to appear in your CoinByte account.
