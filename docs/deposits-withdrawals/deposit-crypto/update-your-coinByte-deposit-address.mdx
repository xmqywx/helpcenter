# Update your CoinByte deposit address

The process of finding your deposit address, or wallet address, is the same for every asset you own. Each asset on CoinByte has a unique deposit address, so you'll need to find the specific address for the asset you want to deposit.

To protect the security of your crypto assets, we will provide instructions in this article on what you need to do in these situations. Thank you for your understanding and support.
