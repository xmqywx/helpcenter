# Crypto Deposit Hasn’t Arrived

If you've deposited crypto to CoinByte but it hasn’t shown up in your account yet, don't worry—we're here to help you investigate the possible causes and what you can do next.

<InfoBox icon="💡">
Some crypto deposits may take up to **1 hour** to be confirmed and reflected in your CoinByte account, depending on network congestion and asset type.
</InfoBox>

## Common Reasons for Missing Deposits
If it’s been more than an hour and your crypto still hasn’t arrived, here's common reasons:

<WarningBox icon="⚠️">
<TickList>
<li><strong>Missing memo or destination tag</strong>: Some assets (e.g., XRP, XLM) require a memo/tag. If it's missing, the deposit may not be automatically credited.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect address or network</strong>: Crypto was sent to the wrong wallet address or on an unsupported network (e.g., sending ETH on BSC instead of Ethereum mainnet).</li>
<li><strong>Unsupported tokens</strong>: Deposits of tokens that are not listed or supported on CoinByte.</li>
</TickList>
</WarningBox>

## What To Do If Your Deposit Is Missing

<RoundStepList>
<li>Check the status of the transaction on the blockchain using the transaction hash (TxID).</li>
<li>Ensure the correct network and address were used, and that any required memo/tag was included.</li>
<li>If everything looks correct but funds haven’t arrived, please contact our <strong>Customer Support</strong> via live chat.</li>
</RoundStepList>

### Information to Prepare

To assist you efficiently, please have the following information ready

<TickList>
<li><strong>Transaction ID (TxID)</strong>: The unique identifier of your transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Sending platform</strong>: The name of the wallet or exchange from which the crypto was sent.</li>
<li><strong>Asset type and amount</strong>: The cryptocurrency involved in the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Time and date</strong> of the transaction.</li>
</TickList>

<WarningBox icon="⚠️">
Most crypto deposits sent with errors—such as missing tags or wrong networks—may be **irreversible or unrecoverable**. Our support team will assess each case, but asset recovery is not guaranteed.
