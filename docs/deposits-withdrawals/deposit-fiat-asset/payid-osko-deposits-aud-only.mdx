## How long do PayID/Osko transfers take?

- Usually instant

### Deposit Delays

Your initial PayID/Osko deposit may take up to 24 business hours to be credited to your CoinByte account due to security protocols implemented by banks.

Additionally, Commonwealth Bank (CBA) and its affiliate Bankwest apply a 24-hour hold on deposits to cryptocurrency trading platforms. This is part of the banks' internal procedures, regardless of whether you have previously made a deposit to our exchange.

**If your deposit is delayed:**

<RoundStepList>
  <li>Check the status of the deposit in your online banking. If it shows as 'Pending', it is still with your bank.</li>
  <li>Contact your bank to inquire about the delay.</li>
  <li>Note that banking business hours apply. For example, if a deposit is made on a Friday or over the weekend, it is likely to arrive by the following Monday.</li>
  <li>If you still can’t find out the reason why your deposit isn’t reaching your CoinByte account, please refer to <strong><a href="/helpcenter/docs/deposits-withdrawals/deposit-fiat-asset/deposit-australian-dollars">Deposit Australian dollars</a></strong>.</li>
