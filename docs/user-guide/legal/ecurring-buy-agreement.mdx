# Recurring Buy Agreement

This Recurring Buy Agreement will remain in effect after the initial Recurring Buy Transaction is completed, and will continue until you modify your Recurring Buy Transaction settings or terminate the transactions through the "Manage your Recurring Buy plan" section in your [CoinByte](https://www.coinbyte.com.au) account. We reserve the right to terminate the Recurring Buy Transactions at any time by notifying you.

In case of insufficient funds, the Recurring Buy will be halted until the fund is sufficient in the account for the next investment cycle.

Please note that Recurring Buy Transactions are not available to corporate users at this time.

By clicking **"Confirm"** to proceed with your Recurring Buy Transactions, you authorize these transactions. It is your responsibility to regularly monitor the status of your Recurring Buy Transactions. We are not obligated to verify the information or details you provide for the Recurring Buy Transactions. All information you submit is assumed to be accurate and complete.

[CoinByte](https://www.coinbyte.com.au) is not responsible for any losses you incur due to unauthorized or incorrect transactions, or for failed transactions resulting from incomplete or outdated information, including but not limited to, insufficient funds, or a deposit reversal, or an unsupported or incompatible payment provider. It is your responsibility to ensure there is adequate balance and/or sufficient funds available in your account. We are also not responsible for any delays (if any) in processing the Recurring Buy Transactions because of the market liquidity. Additionally, we are not liable for any transactions initiated by third parties.

To make changes to your Recurring Buy Transactions, you must terminate the existing transactions in "Active Plan" of Recurring Buy section and create a new order for Recurring Buy Transactions.

We reserve the right to refuse to process, cancel, terminate, or reverse any Recurring Buy Transactions at our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s). This may occur if we suspect the transaction involves, or carries a high risk of involving, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime; if responding to a subpoena, court order, or other legal directive; if we reasonably believe the transaction is erroneous; or if we suspect the transaction violates any applicable restrictions (as listed in the Terms of Service 3.2). In such cases, we will reverse the transaction, and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate the purchase or sale order at the same price or terms as the canceled transaction, nor are we liable for any damages or losses resulting from actions taken according to these terms.
