## What should I do during a scam or after a scam?

If you encounter a scam in the cryptocurrency industry, consider following these essential steps:

<TickList>
<li><strong>Save Conversation Records</strong>: Immediately download and save chat logs with the suspected scammer as a TXT file. These records may become important evidence in future investigations. Relevant platforms include WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, Line, Facebook, Instagram, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Screenshot Key Information</strong>: Capture critical details, such as the scammerâ€™s address, transaction screenshots, false claims made by the scammer, and any information related to the scam website. Make sure the screenshots are clear, including timestamps and transaction data.</li>
<li><strong>Report to Local Authorities</strong>: Report the incident to your local police or law enforcement agencies. Provide as much detail as possible, including time, location, amount involved, chat logs, transfer screenshots, and any other evidence youâ€™ve collected.</li>
<li><strong>Notify Platform Customer Service</strong>: If the scam occurred on a cryptocurrency exchange platform, contact their customer service immediately. Provide them with all the evidence youâ€™ve gathered and ask for quick action to protect other users and resolve the issue. You can easily contact our customer service via OK Assistant.</li>
<li><strong>Trace Asset Movements on the Blockchain</strong>: Use blockchain explorers and other tools to track the flow of assets after the transfer. This may require technical knowledge or expert help, but it can help determine if the funds are still recoverable or have been laundered.</li>
