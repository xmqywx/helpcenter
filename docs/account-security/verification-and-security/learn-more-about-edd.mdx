CoinByte may occasionally ask you to complete **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)** to help protect your funds and comply with AML/CTF and sanctions regulations. EDD helps us understand your **Source of Funds (SOF)** and **Source of Wealth (SOW)** and prevents account misuse.

<InfoBox>
EDD is not a penalty. It is a standard compliance check used across regulated crypto and financial platforms to keep users and the platform safe.

## Why we may ask for EDD

<TickList>
  <li><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong> — We must meet AML/CTF and sanctions requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Account & platform security</strong> — Detect and prevent fraud, money laundering, and sanctions evasion.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency of funds</strong> — Verify the legitimacy and origin of funds to reduce limitations or delays.</li>
