# Close Your Account

We're sorry to see you go. If you wish to close your CoinByte account, please review the important information below before submitting your closure request.

<InfoBox>
ðŸ’¡For legal and compliance purposes, CoinByte is required to retain certain customer and transactional records, even after your account is closed, in accordance with applicable **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** and **Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF)** regulations.
</InfoBox>

## Before You Close Your Account

Please make sure to complete the following checklist before requesting account closure:

<RoundStepList>
<li><strong>Withdraw all balances</strong>: Ensure that both fiat and crypto funds are fully withdrawn. If your account holds small crypto balances (below the trading minimum), you can sell these via <a href="/help/dusting">dusting</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Download your transaction history</strong>: Youâ€™ll no longer have access to this data once your account is closed, so be sure to save any required reports beforehand.</li>
<li><strong>Remove CoinByte bank details</strong>: If youâ€™ve added CoinByte's bank details to your external banking app, delete them now. Deposits to a closed account may result in delays or lost funds.</li>
<li><strong>Submit a closure request via live chat</strong>: Log in to your CoinByte account and start a live chat to request account closure.</li>
</RoundStepList>

<WarningBox>
Please note:
<TickList>
<li><strong>Affiliate rewards</strong> cannot be transferred to another account. After closure, no future affiliate commissions will be paid.</li>
<li>Once your account is closed, you cannot sign up again with the same email address or phone number.</li>
</TickList>
</WarningBox>

## Reopen a Closed Account

If you change your mind after closing your account, you may request to have it reopened by contacting our **Customer Support** team via live chat.
