# Why is my order pending or failed?

Sometimes your order might not complete instantly and may show as **Pending** or **Failed**. This can be due to payment issues, market volatility, or security verifications. Here's a breakdown of the common causes and how you can resolve them.

## Pending status: Common causes and solutions

<TickList>
<li><strong>Blockchain confirmation delays:</strong> On-chain transactions may be waiting for network confirmation. Check your TXID on a blockchain explorer or wait a few more minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Fiat payment still processing:</strong> Some payment methods (e.g., POLi, PayID, card) require additional processing time, especially during weekends or bank downtimes.</li>
<li><strong>Order under risk review:</strong> Unusual or high-value trades may be flagged for verification. Check your email or notifications for KYC or verification requests.</li>
</TickList>

## Failed status: Common causes and solutions

<TickList>
<li><strong>Insufficient balance:</strong> You may not have enough crypto or fiat in your account to cover the trade and associated fees.</li>
<li><strong>Market volatility:</strong> If using a market order during price swings or low liquidity, your order might not fill successfully.</li>
<li><strong>Pair or market under maintenance:</strong> Some trading pairs may be temporarily paused due to platform upgrades or liquidity provider updates.</li>
</TickList>
